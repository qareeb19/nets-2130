# LingoLoop

LingoLoop is a unique, crowdsourced platform that captures and analyzes generational language trends through slang, utilizing both data collection and gamified engagement. This project aims to provide a comprehensive view of how language evolves across different age groups by collecting, moderating, and visualizing slang terms, their definitions, and contextual usage.

## Project Components and Milestones

### Data Collection System

The heart of LingoLoop’s data gathering lies in a custom-built MTurk interface designed to collect slang terms along with demographic data about each contributor. Workers submit slang terms, provide example sentences, and offer definitions. Each component is designed to capture a rich, generationally segmented dataset on evolving language.

Milestones here include creating MTurk HIT templates, implementing user-friendly data collection forms, and setting up demographic-based qualifications for participants before deploying initial tasks.

### Quality Control Module

Ensuring data integrity is crucial for meaningful analysis, so this module filters responses with a range of validation methods. From implementing attention checks and spotting duplicate entries to applying content moderation, this system helps maintain high-quality submissions. A duplicate detection algorithm and response validation pipeline add an additional layer of accuracy.

Key milestones involve setting up attention checks, creating filtering rules, and building the validation pipeline.

### Aggregation Module

The Aggregation Module compiles and organizes the collected data. Statistical analysis functions are created to evaluate trends, with clustering by generation and popularity tracking tools to visualize how terms evolve. This component not only organizes but also synthesizes insights from the data.

Progress here is tracked through creating analysis functions, building clustering capabilities, and setting up tools to monitor term popularity.

### Game Interface

To make exploring language trends interactive and engaging, LingoLoop introduces a gamified experience. This interface generates challenges based on slang familiarity, allows users to test their knowledge, and keeps track of their progress. The game is designed to be a fun way for users to engage with and learn about generational slang trends.

Milestones involve designing game mechanics, implementing a scoring system, creating a challenge generator, and establishing progress tracking.

### Visualization System

LingoLoop includes an interactive visualization system to represent trends dynamically. Users can view generational comparisons, see graphs of slang popularity, and explore their own performance data. Interactive graphs and comparison tools make the data accessible and engaging.

Milestones here include designing trend visualization components, implementing interactive graphs, and building tools for generation-based comparisons.

### Web Application

The web application serves as the platform's front-facing component, where users interact with LingoLoop’s features. It includes a user-friendly interface, API endpoints, integrated database functionality, and a comprehensive search system. This component ensures seamless access and interaction with the collected data.

Milestones include user interface design, API development, database setup, and building a functional search system.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** JavaScript
- **Database:** SupaBase
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API 

With a total of 20 points, each component contributes to making LingoLoop a robust platform for understanding the evolution of slang across generations. The technical stack provides the backbone needed to handle data collection, analysis, and gamified interaction, while AI integration enriches the analysis and insight generation.
